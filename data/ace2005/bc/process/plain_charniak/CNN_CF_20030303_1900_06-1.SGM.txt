Time for `` Fireback , '' when the viewers fire back at us .
Joshua Hosford of Newport Beach , California -- that would be nice in this weathers -- `` Paul , I guess we 're going after all .
Case in point , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed .
It 's amazing how someone can actually do two things at once .
I 'm chewing gum and talking on the phone while writing this note . ''
Joshua , you could n't have said anything better .
In fact , I 've already said it .
Well , in fact , our allies got Mr. Mohammed along with us .
We need allies .
And Bush is so far angered every ally we have .
Dan Snyder of Baden , Pennsylvania writes , `` Bush should torture the al Qaeda chief operations officer .
Bush has been torturing Americans for two years .
Why should this guy get preferential treatment ? ''
-LRB- LAUGHTER -RRB- And I thought he was -- I thought he was busy running the Redskins .
No ?
OK .
The next comment is from Frank Mastro of New York City .
`` Mr. Novak , I do n't understand the problem .
If the budget goes through as is , why do n't Mr. Begala and Mr. Carville just donate the extra tax money they do n't want ? ''
I say that to all the rich millionaire Democrats , like Carville and Begala , who do n't want tax cuts .
Pay it anyway .
I 'll donate to the Democrats .
They 'll defeat Bush and everybody will get rich .
That 's a better strategy .
David Horn of Long Island , New York , writes , `` How can Bush say he 's for democracy ?
He had to sue to become our president , and he keeps trying to bribe other countries ' democratic governments into his supporting his agenda .
Where did he learn to govern , 1930 's Chicago ? ''
