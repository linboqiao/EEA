Well , those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this : MSNBC , an obscure cable channel , has fired Phil Donahue , the host of its highest-rated show .
A memo from inside NBC , reported on the Web site allyourtv.com , and today in `` The Washington Post , '' shows NBC big wigs feared that the liberal Mr. Donahue represented in the words of the NBC memo -- quote -- `` a difficult public face for NBC at a time of war , while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity because he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war , anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration 's motives . ''
So there it is , according to NBC .
Phil Donahue was fired because he 's a liberal .
In fact , the only liberal with the solo cable talk show .
NBC , of course , is a division of the conglomerate GE , where they apparently only bring right wing things to life .
I actually like Phil Donahue .
I 've interviewed him a number of times .
His arguments are really dumb .
I do n't know if you 've listened to Phil Donahue .
Delightful guy , but his arguments do n't make a lot of sense and I think that is the problem with liberal talk show hosts -- you excluded , of course , and James .
But the arguments , actually , do n't hold up very well .
Have you noticed that ?
You know , you can argue back and forth , but you should n't fire someone because of their political views and that 's what NBC has done and shame on the General Electric corporation .
He had the highest-rated show on the network .
Which is saying what ?
I used to work there .
They 're good to me .
They 're very nice people and they 're very good to me ... OK , OK , I 'm not beat up on MSNBC .
... but they should n't fire a guy for his political views .
