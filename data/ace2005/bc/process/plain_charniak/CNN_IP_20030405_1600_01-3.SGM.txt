Thanks very much .
An investigation is under way at a makeshift morgue in southern Iraq after a gruesome discovery by some British troops .
Tim Ewart of ITN News reports on evidence of atrocities at an abandoned Iraqi military base .
It was a discovery that horrified the soldiers who made it .
The remains of hundreds of men were found in plastic bags and Unsealed hard-board coffins .
British troops found the bodies at an abandoned Iraqi military base on the outskirts of Azubayr .
The evidence suggested it was the scene of appalling atrocities .
The teeth in many of the skulls had been broken , and bones appeared to be wrapped in strips of military uniform .
It 's not clear how long the bodies had lain here , but they were clearly not from this war .
You come to expect everything in war fighting .
The coffins were there .
It was a bit more of a surprise when I discovered the bags with the human remains inside .
Inside a neighboring building , there was evidence of cells and a catalog of photographs of the dead .
Most had died from gunshot wounds to the head .
Others were mutilated beyond recognition , their faces burned and swollen .
Outside , soldiers discovered what they described as a purpose - built shooting gallery , the brickwork behind it riddled with bullets .
Identity cards revealed the names of some of the dead .
Forensic specialists will now visit the scene and hope to establish the truth of what happened here and when .

But when they do , British soldiers believe , more horrors will come to light .
