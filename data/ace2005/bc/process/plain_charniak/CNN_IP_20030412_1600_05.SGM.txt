One of the toughest jobs in Iraq right now is that of the military doctor .
CNN medical correspondent , Dr. Sanjay Gupta , has been traveling with the Devil Docs throughout the war and now they are close to Baghdad .
Each of these bangs and explosions comes with a story .
Some we 'll never know .
For others , the stories can be seen in their injuries .
Nobody knows these stories better than the Devil Docs , Naval corpsmen who never look the other way , but rather face what needs to be done without flinching .
They are often the first faces the injured see , be they Iraqi or coalition force members .
Even while statutes were coming down and there was dancing in the streets , the consequences of continuing firefights are seen here .
The work of the Devil Docs is by no means over .
The Navy has set up a helicopter landing zone just a 100 meters from a mobile operating room , just on the outskirts of Baghdad .
This is the closest front line surgical company .
Corpsmen quickly take patients by ambulance away from the blowing sand to a triage tent .
It is there the doctors begin their work .
Over 45 minutes as we watched , 32 patients were delivered here , evaluated and nine operations started ; 29 of those delivered , Marines involved in a firefight in the center of Baghdad .
Their stories could be seen in the shrapnel wounds of rocket-propelled grenades and bullet wounds from semi-automatic weapons .
The operations are on their hands , abdomen and face .
Two of the Marines , too far gone .
For many of the survivors , that news is the most difficult to handle .
Along with the medical care , hands are held , spirits are lifted .
