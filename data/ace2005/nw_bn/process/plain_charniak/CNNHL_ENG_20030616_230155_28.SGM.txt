how could so many people end up in prison for crimes they did n't commit ?
the story behind the defendants of tulia , texas , is our `` headlines timeline . ''
July 23rd , 1999 -- there was a massive drug bust in a predominately african-american neighborhood in tulia .
of the 46 people arrested , 39 are african-american .
the case against them was based on the testimony of undercover officer thomas coleman .
coleman claimed he bought drugs from the defendants , but offered little or no supporting evidence .
after the first of several trials ended with convictions and harsh sentences , most of the other defendants pleaded guilty to avoid hard time .
march 17 , 2003 -- with coleman 's credibility under serious attack , new hearings for the tulia defendants get under way .
the hearings are stopped when the judge , defense attorneys and prosecutors agree that coleman lied under oath and is a racist .
coleman denies doing anything wrong .
it took a special act of the texas legislature to clear the way for Monday 's release .
but these men and the others caught up in the tulia tragedy are still convicted criminals .
now it 's up to the appeals court and the board of pardon and paroles to officially clear their names .
