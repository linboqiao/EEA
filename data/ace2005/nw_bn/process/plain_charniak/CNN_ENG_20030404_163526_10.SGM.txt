we turn now to an iraqi -- first of all , before we tell you about this story , we were going to , these are live pictures from baghdad .
there 's been some activity in the last few moments .
looks like tracer fire we 're looking at , anti-aircraft guns firing at what they sense is some sort of threat coming from the skies .
baghdad has had sporadic episodes of this tonight .
no major explosions we 're aware of , but just , apparently , in the last few moments , there has been activity .
you can see it there just now .
we 've been reporting , the city has begun to see its electricity turned back on .
we do n't know that all ofist is back , but at least some of it is .
we also know that 12 miles southwest of the city , coalition forces remain largely in control of what was formerly saddam hussein international airport , now renamed by the coalition baghdad international airport .
but the coalition is quick to point out that they do not have control of the area immediately surrounding the airport .
again , this is -- these are live pictures of baghdad , where it is well into the night .
we 're , of course , going to keep monitoring the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything we learn .
