we try to bring you the work of still photographers who are applying their trade in iraq these days .
tonight patrick baas from afp looking at what he 's done this week .
it is clear he has two of the things you need to be a photo photojournalist .
a great eye and nose for where the news is .
i 'm lebanese born .
i grew up in war zones .
it 's like my life .
i was the only one during this conflict who had pictures of republican guards and it 's true luck because i was driving northwest of baghdad and i bumped into these guys going around the capital .
we recognized them because of their uniform .
very close to the u.s. marines uniform .
i did n't see fear in their eyes .
i did n't feel any i did n't realize what the fire power was .
it was an american tank that had techmy call problems .
had to stop an attack south of baghdad .
they really believed on the tank .
i was taking pictures .
the reporter was with me .
wanted to go in .
i said , no. while
