that her younger sister , mary katherine , was the one who went to her father and said , `` dad , i think i know who did this . ''
but it took some four months before they were able to get a picture and identify the picture as this brian david mitchell and then his wife , wanda barzee .
the other questions , of course , are why did n't elizabeth smart try to escae ?
were there opportunities perhaps that she might ab vible to -- able to get away from her abductors ?
the police are saying she was abducted by knife point and was an opportunity and may have been some kind of fear factor going on .
we are seeing a lot locally here some photographs that are coming out that show the three , that show mitchell , his wife , and who they believe to be elizabeth smart at a party in September .
there were times perhaps they were in a park somewhere in salt lake city completely robed in these veiled and robes so you could not see her face .
there are a lot of questions coming out about why she could not get away from them , that remains to be answered .
the police are going to be holding a press conference later today .
we 're hoping to get more details about that .
