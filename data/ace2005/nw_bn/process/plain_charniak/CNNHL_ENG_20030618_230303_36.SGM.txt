it looks like an annual tradition is building .
80,000 people with a shared love of music converge on a tennessee pasture for three days of good vibes and who knows what else .
it 's called bonnaroo .
check it out .
bonnaroo is kind of this going example of what the whole jam band community is turned in .
that 's what i really like about the jam community .
it 's acceptance of improvizational music , dpes pit whatever region or gen re .
it 's about the freedom of the music and the freedom of expression .
well , we sold all 80,000 tickets through our web site .
we sold out in 16 days .
i mean , the amazing thing is , we used no traditional advertising .
we put all these bands together .
it draws a huge audience .
so the record companies and the music business has to take all of these forms of music more seriously .
it 's like strength in numbers .
i hope this kind of thing can happen in america , instead of it just being these isolated festivals like bonnaroo , it really can happen in 100 cities every summer , like the festivals do in europe .
my only complaint is the overlapping .
you know , as a music lover that i am , there 's five acts all playing at the same time on five different stages that i want to see .
it really comes from the actual bands and the fact that there 's this grassroots following that 's been there , you know , for a long time .
primarily started by the grateful dead , at least the future by the grateful dead .
we will get0 by we will survive we 're carrying on a tradition that started a long time .
in american music , improvization is what it 's always been arped .
it 's not just clapping and having a good time .
it makes you feel a certain kind of love , and hopefully , that translates in the community .
you go out , you hug someone .
you do something good .
you make a better world .
for me , that 's music .
we love you .
we
