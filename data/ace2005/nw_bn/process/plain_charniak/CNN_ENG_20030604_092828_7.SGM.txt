moving onto the laci peterson case bill , an unusual request from scott peterson 's attorney .
a pair of laci peterson 's missing shoes could be very important evidence in scott 's murder trial .
she asking anyone who finds the pair to give them back .
no sign of geragos or peterson in court yesterday when a judge was considering whether to unseal warrants obtained before scott peterson 's arrest .
