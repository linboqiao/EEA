HONG KONG -LRB- AP -RRB- The Hong Kong Jockey Club is in talks about buying out the horse racing club in neighboring Macau , a newspaper reported Tuesday .
The South China Morning Post quoted Hong Kong Jockey Club Chief Executive Lawrence Wong as saying the discussions were underway , but no price was reported .
The Hong Kong club is a charitable entity , while the Macau Jockey Club is a for-profit concern controlled by gambling tycoon Stanley Ho .
Hong Kong angered Macau 's gaming industry last year when it banned gamblers in Hong Kong from placing horse bets with anyone but the Hong Kong Jockey Club .
Macau had been taking off-track bets from people in Hong Kong , but the offices handling those wagers were closed .
The Macau club later threatened to start taking wagers on Hong Kong races in Macau , at a better price for gamblers because less tax would be levied , but the plan never materialized .
Neither club immediately returned phone calls from The Associated Press to inquire about the buyout talks .
Macau is a gambling enclave 60 kilometers -LRB- 40 miles -RRB- west of Hong Kong that was governed by the Portuguese for more than four centuries before it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1999 .
Hong Kong , a former British colony , returned to Chinese rule in 1997 .
