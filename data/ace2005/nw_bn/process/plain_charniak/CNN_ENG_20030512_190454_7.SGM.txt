the story of a woman in an east texas jail cell tonight .
we 're told sometimes she sits in the fetal position , other times singing gospel music .
occasionally she 'll pray , sometimes cries hysterically .
her name is deanna lejeune laney .
she 's accused of beating two of her three children to death because , she says , god told her to .
now that happened this Saturday .
today the wheels of justice began turning .
katherine garcia of wfaa joins from us the smith county courthouse in tyler , texas .
