and now joining us by phone from liverpool with more on the harry potter heist is caroline forham , press officer with the mercy side police .
it 's come to stealing childrens books , is it ?
i think these are profitable childrens book .
so very popular .
i think that people think they probably are lucrative for them .
as you mentioned , if anyone is seen to be selling these on the black market they will be prosecuted .
is that why you think they were stolen , sale before the deadline or after ?
i think probably they know they can make more money before the deadline on these books .
but i know no reputable book shop will take these stolen goods and sell them .
i think we are looking at in market stores and sales over the next coming days .
we have police officers looking for them and will prosecute anyone seen selling them or buying them .
considering how much publicity was circulating about this book , there is injunctions about publishing anything or talking about the plot .
what kind of security was there in place for any truck carrying books ?
the books were stolen from a warehouse , they have their own security measures .
they did have their ccpb operational , we are looking at that to see if
