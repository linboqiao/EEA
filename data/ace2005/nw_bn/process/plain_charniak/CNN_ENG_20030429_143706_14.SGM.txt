now an update on a story that touched all our lives .
remember ali abbas who lost both his arms , his home , many of his relatives in a bombing on baghdad ?
as you might imagine , his will to live would not -- was not very strong at first .
mark webster of itn has an update for us .
reporter : after so much suffering , his gentle smile said it all .
two weeks in hospital and ali is recovering fast .
happily watching tom and jerry on his mini television , his transformation from the pain-racked boy who left baghdad .
with the encouragement of his doctors , we visited him in the intensive care unit .
they 're confident he wo n't be here much longer .
i will say he will come out of the burn unit in three weeks time , but he will be , you know , in kuwait until we find him really constructive plan that takes into consideration all aspects of his needs , psychological , social and future plan .
reporter : since ali is an ardent football fan , we gave him a manchester united shirt specially signed by all the players .
pride of face went to his favorite player , david beckham , who surprised everyone with his response .
thank you very much .
reporter : gifts
