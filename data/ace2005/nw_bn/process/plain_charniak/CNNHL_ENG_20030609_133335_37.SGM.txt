but a toymaker and one man 's dream have put the silver cross pram back on the stroller circuit .
here 's jim boulden .
reporter : a well-heeled baby like princess , seen .
the distinctive karbages stroll tlued london 's fashionable parks way nanny at the ready .
that is , until silver cross went out of business last year .
all is not lost for the rich and famous baby .
a toy company bought the silver cross name so they could make toy versions .
then one former worker persuaded the company to let him make the real ones again .
i went away for two weeks , reflected on my future and feel i could n't convince myself until it was over .
i felt t7ire was something else too , much history behind silver cross to end is now .
reporter : he bought the machinery , moved to a new factory , rehired some of the old workers and started heritage programs .
it 's been near lay year since the last program was manufactured at the old factory .
