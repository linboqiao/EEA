WASHINGTON , May 27 -LRB- AFP -RRB- US President George W. Bush told Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien by telephone Monday that he looked forward to seeing him at the upcoming summit of major industrialized nations and Russia , the White House said Tuesday .
`` The two leaders discussed the upcoming G-8 meeting , US-Canada -LRB- relations -RRB- and other international issues of concern , '' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said days before the June 1-3 summit , to be held in France .
`` Both said they look forward to seeing each other in Evian .
They also touched on Afghanistan , the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and on the global economy , '' said Fleischer .
Amid a chill in relations over the war in Iraq , which Canada opposed , Bush indefinitely postponed a visit to Canada , instead choosing to host Australian Prime Minster John Howard , who endorsed that military campaign .
On Monday , Chretien told reporters that he and Bush , who had not spoken since late February , discussed a wide range of issues , including Iraq , the upcoming summit of the Group of Eight industrial powers and aid to Africa .
`` We 've always been on good terms .
We just disagree on one item , '' the Canadian leader said .
