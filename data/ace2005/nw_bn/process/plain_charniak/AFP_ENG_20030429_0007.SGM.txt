SEOUL , April 29 -LRB- AFP -RRB- South Korea 's ruling party is facing an internal reformist call for dissolving itself to create a new group after a humiliating defeat at last week 's by-elections , party officials said Tuesday .
The ruling Millennium Democratic Party -LRB- MDP -RRB- , founded by former president Kim Dae-Jung , has suffered declining popularity since President Roh Moo-Hyun took office in February .
A group of 18 reformist MDP lawmakers , mostly Roh 's confidants , demanded late Wednesday that the party be `` constructively dissolved '' to create a new grouping , MDP officials said .
But the established MDP leadership has opposed the sudden overhaul , they added .
Reformist MDP members , however , vowed to launch a preparatory committee next month and to make `` tangible progress '' in the process of forging a new party .
The internal dispute erupted after the MDP lost three parliamentary seats in Thursday 's by-elections .
The opposition Grand National Party -LRB- GNP -RRB- took two of the National Assembly seats while a splinter reformist party got the third .
With the latest wins , the GNP increased its majority in the 272-seat National Assembly to 153 seats against 101 for the MDP .
General elections are due in April next year .
