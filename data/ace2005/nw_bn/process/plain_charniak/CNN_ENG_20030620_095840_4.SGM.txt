dog chapman was in the same truck you saw .
at one point , the mexican police busted both andrew luster and dwayne dog chapman , because they do n't like bounty hunters in mexico .
chapman remains behind bars as we speak in mexico .
andrew luster , though arrived yesterday at los angeles international airport on a commercial flight from mexico .
as soon as he arrived -- thoom being walked by the fbi to a van belonging to the ventura county sheriff 's folks .
he was taken to a prison in kearn county , california , about 100 miles from los angeles , a place mostly known for its grapes .
make of that what you may .
heidi ?
